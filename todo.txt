TODO:
=====

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------
o  tool: solve: fix bug on level 30 ( possibly 43 and 48 ) - we are prioritising depth instead of moves (!)
o  tool: Better warnings on tool when running out of memory
o  web: Check css media brackets on chrome


LOW PRIORITY
------------
o  Publish!
o  Consider adding an undo button
o  tool: Consider bisolve (where solve and unsolve meet in middle)
